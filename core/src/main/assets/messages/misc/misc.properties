utils.difficulty.isekai=That time when I got reincarnated as a weakling and got beaten to death by a rat immediately after waking up, but I tried over and over and after ten thousand years of trying I finally managed to break through shackles of me weakness and conquered the dungeon, but then I woke up and realized that it was only a sick dream this whole time, so I walked outside to get something to drink, but I got hit by a truck, so I died and got reincarnated again but this time for real, and this new world was even more cruel than before, so I tried to form a party, but parties were banned by the International Dungeoneering Council, so I got arrested and thrown into Prison, but I realized that Prison is in fact a lower level of a dungeon, far deeper than I ever delved, so I got trained for 40 years by elder spirit of the ninja until I became the strongest man in whole prison under the nickname of Tengu, but then ten black slimes emerged from level above and destroyed me, so I had to retreat to even deeper part of dungeon, where I spent 80 years learning engineering and ultimately built a great Digital Postage Meter named DM-3000, but it rivaled against me and in fierce battle I got defeated once again and fell into the pit where I was found by dwarves, so I had to spend next 150 years as slave to Dwarf King, but eventually he got corrupted by dark powers so in order to save my life I once again delved deeper just to find Halls filled with demons, so I used my holy powers granted to me by gods to make my way to the great Demon King, just to find out it was a giant Eye all this time, so I hit it and got smashed by huge fist, ultimately ending my journey, but next moment I woke up in a Prison cell realizing that I have power of rewinding time and have to suffer forever in this cursed Dungeon
